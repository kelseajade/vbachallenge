I created VBA Script to analyze three years of stock market data. 
The script loops through worksheets to find the ticker symbol, yearly change in price, percentage change from the bbeginning of year to end of year, and the total stock volume. 
There is conditional formatting for Yearly Change. If the price stayed the same or increased it is green, but if the price decreased the column is red.

The script finds the stock with the greatest increase, greatest decrease and greatest total volume.

The script runs for each worksheet added.
